# Portfolio Website - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview
This document summarizes all the design enhancements, fixes, and improvements made to the portfolio website.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **CSS & JavaScript Loading Issues** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: CSS and JavaScript files were not loading, causing the entire site to be unstyled.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect file paths - files were in `src/` directories but HTML referenced them in root.

**Solution**:
- Updated all CSS paths: `style.css` ‚Üí `src/styles/style.css`
- Updated all JS paths: `script.js` ‚Üí `src/scripts/script.js`
- Updated all image paths: `images/` ‚Üí `src/assets/images/`
- Applied fixes to both `index.html` and `projects.html`

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html`
- `projects.html`

---

### 2. **Border-Radius Breaking on Hover** (VISUAL BUG)
**Problem**: Card corners lost their rounded appearance during 3D tilt animations, with images overlapping the edges.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Missing `isolation: isolate` property causing stacking context issues
2. Image container lacking border-radius
3. Duplicate `::before` pseudo-element creating unwanted 4px bar

**Solution**:
- Added `isolation: isolate` to `.project-card` to create proper stacking context
- Added `border-radius: var(--radius-2xl) var(--radius-2xl) 0 0` to `.project-image-container`
- Removed duplicate `::before` element (lines 2416-2429 in style.css)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/styles/style.css`
- `src/styles/projects-page.css` (already had isolation: isolate)
